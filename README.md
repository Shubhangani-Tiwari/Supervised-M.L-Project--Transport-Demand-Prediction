# Supervised-M.L-Project--Transport-Demand-Prediction.

Problem Statement:

This challenge asks me to build a model that predicts the number of seats that Mobiticket can expect to sell for each ride, i.e. for a specific route on a specific date and time. There are 17 routes in this dataset. All of the routes end in Nairobi and originate in towns to the North-West of Nairobi towards Lake Victoria.

The towns from which these routes originate are:

1.Awendo

2.Homa Bay

3.Kehancha

4.Kendu Bay

5.Keroka

6.Keumbu

7.Kijauri

8.Kisii

9.Mbita

10.Migori

11.Ndhiwa

12.Nyachenge

13.Oyugis

14.Rodi

15.Rongo

16.Sirare

17.Sori

The routes from these 17 origins to the first stop in the outskirts of Nairobi takes approximately 8 to 9 hours from time of departure. From the first stop in the outskirts of Nairobi into the main bus terminal, where most passengers get off, in Central Business District, takes another 2 to 3 hours depending on traffic.

The three stops that all these routes make in Nairobi (in order) are:

1.Kawangware: the first stop in the outskirts of Nairobi

2.Westlands

3.Afya Centre: the main bus terminal where most passengers disembark

All of these points are mapped here. Passengers of these bus (or shuttle) rides are affected by Nairobi traffic not only during their ride into the city, but from there they must continue their journey to their final destination in Nairobi wherever that may be. Traffic can act as a deterrent for those who have the option to avoid buses that arrive in Nairobi during peak traffic hours. On the other hand, traffic may be an indication for people’s movement patterns, reflecting business hours, cultural events, political events, and holidays.

Methods Used:

1.Descriptive Statistics
2.Data Visualization
2.Machine Learning

Technologies:

1.Python
2.Pandas
3.Numpy
4.Matplotlib
5.Seaborn
6.Scikit-learn

Project Description:

EDA - Performed exploratory data analysis on numerical and categorical data.

Data Cleaning - Missing value imputation,Outlier Treatment

Feature Selection - Used information gain for feature selection and dropped features which had less information gain Model development - Tried different model and finally compared all models accuracies, r2 score ,adjusted r2 score and all the evaluation criteria.

Needs of this project:

1.data exploration/descriptive statistics

2.data processing/cleaning

3.predictive modeling
